# Main CoffeeScript file.
#
# Usage:
#
#   # In the root of this project run gulp.
#   gulp
#
#   # Then, modify this script and there will be a file
#   # with the same name as this and extension `.js` at
#   `app/static/js/`.
#
#
# Help:
#
#   If you're new to CoffeeScript, you can hop to the docs
#   to learn more: http://coffeescript.org/
#
#   Also, there's a nice js to coffee converter to get started.
